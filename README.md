Birthday website! 🎁

I made a Website for my girlfriend's birthday.
Just a simple static website with 3 pages.

FIRST PAGE - Login page, she had to gusse the password to be able to login. It's our anniversary - 4.3.2017 without the dots, only the numbers.
My website dosen't have a server side, it's a very simple website and also the security, so you can see the password in the DevTools.
The website didn't need a server side and I don't mind that anyone can see the password -> just revealed it... 😁

SECOND PAGE - Happy Birthday blessing with some photos and Lorem Ipsum text.

THIRD PAGE - Simple cards page with photos and buttons that suposed to play some Audio but I removed it because it was personal.

Enjoy!
